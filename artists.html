            Almost every K-pop group has a fan club made up of K-pop fans who are generally called Kpoppers or Kpop stans. These fandom's names are not merely words thrown together at the last minute; they carry a special meaning and some K-pop fandoms have become as popular as the artists it is dedicated to.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are loads of Kpop fandoms out there, though the exact number is not known but we do know that there are more than 99 million Kpop fans making up these numerous fandoms!
            These Kpop groups' fandom names are sometimes based on the most popular songs sung by the group, or sometimes they are based on values that the group and their fans hold in high esteem.

            <h3>Start voice and dance training at an early age.</h3>
            <p>
              You can audition as early as 12 years old at many Kpop auditions. Therefore, getting a full two years of experience in dancing and voice training is recommended before auditioning. That means at the earliest you should be training at age 10. The average age of those who audition is 18 years old (from 12-25 years old). Still, you should start training at age 16 at the latest.

            <h3>Dancing is more important than Singing</h3>
            <p>
              We recommend focusing on dancing as most interested in entering K-pop can sing or rap. Your focus should be on hip-hop, contemporary, and urban dancing. For those who do not have the funds to take Kpop dancing lessons, there are hundreds of Kpop dance tutorials on YouTube videos that can help you. Commit to at least 30 hrs a week to become a more versatile dancer
