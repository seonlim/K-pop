                            Before the early 1990s, it was only solo artists doing trot. Then in 1992, South Korean music started shifting to a more hip hop-influenced sound with the debut of Seo Taiji and Boys, who used English in their songs. It was not until SM Entertainment founder Lee Soo-man created several groups such as H.O.T. and Shinhwa that the Hallyu Wave started. The first generation of K-pop began with the birth of the idol industry after the debut of H.O.T. in 1996 and follows the early years of K-pop and includes idol groups debuting from 1997 to 2002.

                        <strong>2nd Generation</strong>
                        <p>
                            As the popular first-generation idols disbanded during the early 2000s, ballads and R&B music became mainstream in the Korean music industry again. Since 2003, singers such as SG Wannabe, Wheesung, and Buzz became very popular.

                            K-pop saw a revival with the third generation that grew in the digital age with the influence of social media and resulted in the globalization of the genre. This era also saw a growth in survival programs that pushed for more competition, and includes idol groups that primarily debuted in 2012 to the end of 2019.
